# hello-world
New to GitHub
Hi Coders
I am Rajiv, did my Pega certifications but don't have hands on experience working on it, so trying to get some coding basics with the help of GitHub.
Back in India I used to work for Bank of America for 6 years in the backend operations (end users of the applications) not related to IT. Did my Masters here in the USA.
